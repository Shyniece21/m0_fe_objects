# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? I found that I had to research a lot (google, youtube, etc.) so it took me a lot of time to understand what I needed to know and move through the challenges.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? Note-taking is helping me to create documents that I can reference and it helps with trying to retain the information I am learning. I try to do so when I am in class but usually I take the best notes when I am going through the information on my own.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I typically try to solve it on my own and from there I will reference my notes, google and ask for help as a last resort.
